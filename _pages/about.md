Although changes in basic physiology have been observed in schizophrenia since early conceputalizations of the disorder, the topic has gone largely under-researched using more modern techniques. Furthermore, there have been few efforts to characterize the course and mechanisms of these changes. To address this gap, I am interested in characterizing changes in basic physiology in individuals at a clinical high risk for psychosis using techniques like pupillometry, eyetracking, and electrocardiography. Furthermore, I am interested in integrating these changes with higher-level outcomes, such as interoceptive and emotional experiences.

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at Northwestern University under the guidance of Dr. Vijay Mittal. Prior to my graduate career, I worked as a research assistant and coordinator with Dr. Katharine Thakkar at Michigan State University. I completed two Bachelors of Science degrees at Michigan State University in 2020 in Neuroscience and Psychology.
